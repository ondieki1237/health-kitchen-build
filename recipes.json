If you want to roast the seeds (totally advisable), rinse them off and set aside. Pack the stuffing inside the pumpkins, replace tops. Put the pumpkins on a baking sheet in the preheated oven, and cover with tinfoil or an additional baking sheet inverted. Pop in the oven, check after 20 minutes, check after an additional 10-20 minutes. Pumpkins are done when they are slightly soft, and slightly brown. Serve 😋😋😋 with the lids on, and let eaters open them.*",

        "Prep fruit: Wash the oranges and lemon, thoroughly scrubbing the peels.",
        "Chop: Cut off the ends of the oranges. Cut the oranges in half, then cut each half into 4, so you’re left with 8 pieces of orange. Discard any seeds.",
        "Puree: Place the orange pieces in a food processor and pulse/chop until the rind is in very small pieces. Place a plate in the freezer, to help us test for doneness later.",

        "Add oranges to a large saucepan over medium heat. Zest the lemon into the pot and squeeze the juice from it, into the pot. Add water and the sugar and stir well.",
        "Cook: bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to a low boil and simmer, stirring often, for 30-35 minutes until thickened. When done, it will slide off the spoon in sheets, not droplets, and a spoonful poured onto a cold plate should be a soft gel consistency that moves slightly. If after pouring onto a cold plate it’s thin and runs easily on the plate, it is not ready, so continue cooking.",

        "*Notes*",
        "Oranges: Preferably organic oranges since the skins have not been treated with pesticides and aren’t waxy. Choose thin skinned, oranges for best results, so there’s less plith to make the marmalade bitter.",
        "Recommended oranges for marmalade: naval, Seville, Cara Cara, blood oranges, mandarin, tangerines, or a combination.",
        "Sweetener: helps preserve the marmalade, balance the flavors, and helps it to set up. You could try using ½ sugar and ½ Splenda/sweetener, but I don’t recommended reducing the sugar unless you are okay with a runnier marmalade, and only if you don’t plant to can/preserve it.",

        "The easiest way to incubate and culture your homemade vegan yogurt is with an Instant Pot that has a yogurt setting. That will keep it at a consistent temperature throughout with no effort from you. And it's no secret that I love my Instant Pot. I use it for something nearly every single day, including recipes like my Instant Pot Black Beans, Instant Pot Portobello Pot Roast and Instant Pot Tomato Soup and also for cooking rice, grains and oatmeal etc.",
        "A yogurt maker would work well too and if you don't have either of those then you will need to keep your yogurt at a temperature of between 29 ° C (85 ° F) and 46 ° C (115 ° F). Anything below 29 ° C (85 ° F) and you'll have trouble getting it to culture.",
        "It is also really important that the yogurt doesn't get close to or above 49°C (120 °F) because at that temperature the yogurt cultures will start to be killed off and the recipe won't work. Because of this I highly suggest you check the temperature of the yogurts location with a thermometer before you start incubating it if you aren't using the controlled environment of an Instant Pot or yogurt maker.",
        "*Here are some suggestions for ways to keep your yogurt warm so it cultures successfully:*",

        "In your oven - Preheat your oven to 200 ° C (400 °F) for 1 minute then turn it off. Sit your jars on a baking tray and place them in the oven on the top shelf with the oven light on. Do not open the door for at least 10 hours or the heat will escape.",
        "Use your home heating - Place your jars of yogurt near (but not too near) the furnace, radiator, fireplace, stove.",
        "On top of your fridge/fridge freezer - This is usually a nice warm spot and works well if you don't have built in appliances.",

        "Do not omit the sweetener. It is necessary for the bacteria to feed on. Don't worry, your yogurt won't taste sweet because it's all consumed by the time the yogurt has fermented.",
        "Canned light coconut milk should be used to make this vegan yogurt recipe. I don't recommend using full fat coconut milk as it will make the yogurt too firm and it also tends to cause separation to occur. Don't be tempted to buy full fat canned coconut milk and dilute it yourself to make \"light\" coconut milk. That will not work in this recipe.",
        "Blend everything absolutely thoroughly.",
        "Ensure the yogurt you use to \"seed\" your yogurt is a cultured/live one. Most are but double check. If you don't like the results using a particular brand of yogurt try another one next time. Better quality yogurts will give better results.",
        "Makes sure everything is very, very clean.",
        "For this recipe I recommend incubating the yogurt in glass jars. I do not recommend you make it in one big pot, like the Instant Pot's inner pot. This is because this yogurt gets the very best texture when it is completely undisturbed while it incubates and chills. If you stir it or disturb it you will lose the lovely thick, creamy texture.",
        "If using an Instant Pot do not set your jars on the trivet. They need to be directly in contact with the inner pot. Don't use the trivet at all.",
        "Don't use metal utensils, pots or bowls as there's a small chance prolonged contact with them could harm the bacteria in the yogurt.",

        "If using an Instant Pot - Place the uncovered yogurt filled jars into the metal inner pot of the Instant Pot. Do not use the trivet and do not add any water to the pot. The jars should be in direct contact with the bottom of the pot and have no lids or other covering on them. Place the lid of the Instant Pot on and close it, then close the steam vent. Press the yogurt button (check that the display says \"normal\" and not \"boil\", then adjust the time depending on how long you would like your yogurt to ferment. I suggest a minimum of 10 hours. That will give you a nice thickness and a slight tang. 11.5 hours will give you a more pronounced tang and is how long I leave mine. Do not disturb the Instant Pot/yogurt during this time. You can check it after 10 or 11 hours though. Use a spoon to take a little bit from one jar (without stirring it up first)and taste it. Put the Instant Pot back on again for another hour or two if it's not quite tangy enough.",

        "If your house is cooler than that, turn your oven to 200 ° C (400 °F) for just 1 minute and no longer. Then turn it off and turn the oven light on. Place the covered jars on a baking tray (for stability) in the oven on the top shelf, with just the oven light on. Do not open the door while it is culturing or you will let the heat out. Also make sure that no-one turns the oven on. A note stuck to the door is a good idea.",
        "Do not disturb the yogurt while it is culturing. At 38 ° C (100 °F) the yogurt will take between 10 to 12 hours to culture, thicken nicely and get a good tang. If the temperature is cooler than that it will take longer and if it's warmer then it will happen more quickly. I suggest testing it by scooping a tiny bit out and tasting it after about 10 hours have passed, then add on more time if you want it to be tangier.",
        "Remember that at anything much below a temperature of 29 ° C (85 ° F), culturing the yogurt could be problematic, and anything much over 49°C (120 °F) and the good bacteria will be killed. The yogurt will not culture if that happens. To be absolutely sure that conditions will be right I suggest having a practice run before. Check the temperature of your oven with a thermometer after your oven has preheated for the 1 minute and the light has been turned on. If you find it isn't in the right temperature range there are more suggestions in the recipe notes for ways to incubate.",

        "Once the yogurt has incubated and has reached the right amount of tanginess for you, cover securely with a lid and refrigerate thoroughly. Do not stir it.

        "You may have seen some of my tempeh recipes and wondered what tempeh is. For starters, it’s a plant-based protein made of cooked soybeans (think edamame) that have been fermented. The fermentation process binds the soybeans into a cake/patty, which is what you’ll find at your local grocery store. Some varieties of tempeh only include soybeans, but others will contain grains like barley, rice, flax or millet along with the soybeans.",
        "*What Does Tempeh Taste Like?*",
        "Tempeh on its own has a mild, nutty flavor that’s often described as earthy. Like most proteins, it really takes on the flavor of the dish! When prepared with marinades or sauces, it absorbs those flavors and the end result is so tasty.",
        "Tempeh vs. Tofu",
        "Tempeh is related to tofu, but they aren’t the same thing! They are both made from soy, but other than that they’re actually quite different.",
        "Tempeh is less processed, fermented and has a stronger flavor and a bit more texture. Tofu is more processed and has a milder flavor with basically no texture! Tofu can be blended up into a creamy sauce or soup or can be fried for more texture, but in general it is much smoother than tempeh.",
        "I also find tempeh a bit easier to work with because there’s minimal prep work. With tofu you have to account for extra time to press it and with tempeh you simply open the package and you’re ready to chop and cook!",
        "Side by side tempeh rectangles. On the left, the tempeh is out of the packaging, on the right is Lightlife tempeh in the packaging.",

I gravitate towards the Three Grain variety because it is the mildest in terms of taste, but I like the original as well!",

        "As I mentioned above, tempeh is a fermented food. This fermentation process breaks down phytic acid, which can inhibit mineral absorption. This means the minerals in tempeh are easier to digest and tempeh is also less likely to cause gas or indigestion when compared to other beans. I don’t know about you, but less gas and bloating is always a win in my book!",

I honestly don’t take the time to do this, but if you’d like to try it here’s the process. To steam the tempeh, cut it as desired, place in a steamer basket, cover and steam for 10-15 minutes. If you don’t have a steamer basket, you can fill a saucepan with 1-2 inches of water and bring it to a boil. Once boiling place the tempeh in the saucepan, cover and reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes.",
        "My favorite way to make tempeh taste amazing is to marinate it! You can marinate in the fridge anywhere from one hour to overnight.

        "You may have seen some of my tempeh recipes and wondered what tempeh is. For starters, it’s a plant-based protein made of cooked soybeans (think edamame) that have been fermented. The fermentation process binds the soybeans into a cake/patty, which is what you’ll find at your local grocery store. Some varieties of tempeh only include soybeans, but others will contain grains like barley, rice, flax or millet along with the soybeans.",
        "*What Does Tempeh Taste Like?*",
        "Tempeh on its own has a mild, nutty flavor that’s often described as earthy. Like most proteins, it really takes on the flavor of the dish! When prepared with marinades or sauces, it absorbs those flavors and the end result is so tasty.",
        "Tempeh vs. Tofu",
        "Tempeh is related to tofu, but they aren’t the same thing! They are both made from soy, but other than that they’re actually quite different.",
        "Tempeh is less processed, fermented and has a stronger flavor and a bit more texture. Tofu is more processed and has a milder flavor with basically no texture! Tofu can be blended up into a creamy sauce or soup or can be fried for more texture, but in general it is much smoother than tempeh.",
        "I also find tempeh a bit easier to work with because there’s minimal prep work. With tofu you have to account for extra time to press it and with tempeh you simply open the package and you’re ready to chop and cook!",
        "Side by side tempeh rectangles. On the left, the tempeh is out of the packaging, on the right is Lightlife tempeh in the packaging.",

I gravitate towards the Three Grain variety because it is the mildest in terms of taste, but I like the original as well!",

        "As I mentioned above, tempeh is a fermented food. This fermentation process breaks down phytic acid, which can inhibit mineral absorption. This means the minerals in tempeh are easier to digest and tempeh is also less likely to cause gas or indigestion when compared to other beans. I don’t know about you, but less gas and bloating is always a win in my book!",

I honestly don’t take the time to do this, but if you’d like to try it here’s the process. To steam the tempeh, cut it as desired, place in a steamer basket, cover and steam for 10-15 minutes. If you don’t have a steamer basket, you can fill a saucepan with 1-2 inches of water and bring it to a boil. Once boiling place the tempeh in the saucepan, cover and reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes.",

        "And we're here to demonstrate it! When mushrooms are oven-roasted at high temperatures for a brief period of time, the water is able to escape, leaving behind soft, melt-in-your-mouth interiors and golden-brown caramelized exteriors. You'll find earthy, meaty, herbaceous, and crave-worthy bits of flavor in this recipe for roasted mushrooms. They just require eight ingredients and are quick, simple, and extremely tasty. These are vegan and paleo-friendly, making them the ideal savory side for all dietary requirements! We also enjoy dry-sauté mushrooms, even though roasting them is the simplest way to prepare them and intensify their flavor.",
        "Are Roasted Mushrooms Good For You?",
        "Oven roasted mushrooms are super underrated! Not only are they earthy, savory, and meaty but also are packed with nutrients! Roasted mushrooms in the oven are generally low in calories and fat and are great to bulk up a meal. They contain Vitamin D, riboflavin, potassium and are a good source of fiber! Some experts even say that roast mushrooms can help boost your immune system, have anti-cancer properties, and lower your blood pressure due to their antioxidants!",

        "…is one of the most common questions we get asked! No one likes soggy, slimy mushrooms and so we’re here to give you all the tips and tricks, for tender, flavorful mushrooms oven roasted with toasty, crispy exteriors:",
        "Gently clean your mushrooms with a paper towel rather than running them under cold water.",
        "Since mushrooms are a high water content food, meaning that their sponge-like structure allows for water to be released during cooking, we recommend that if juices pool halfway through baking, drain them off the tray so they continue to roast instead of steam.",
        "When in doubt, salt after, prevents the water from being released more rapidly during cooking.",
        "_What to Serve with Roasted Mushrooms_",
        "Oven-roasted mushrooms can go with just about any dish: they’re extremely versatile, light yet still hearty!",
        "Sprinkle them over our Creamy Mashed Potatoes and Green Bean Almondine. Add them to Alfredo Sauce or Homemade Marinara to bulk up the sauce. They also go great with pasta such as Vegan Cauliflower Gnocchi, Sausage Kale Pasta with Lemon Cream Sauce, or Creamy Roasted Red Pepper Pasta. There are so many ways to devour roasted mushrooms but our favorite way is straight from the baking sheet.",
        "_How to Roast Mushrooms_",
        "Follow our step-by-step instructions below for perfectly crispy outsides and tender insides each and every time:",
        "Prep! For our roasted mushrooms recipe, we use cremini mushrooms but you can make it your own and roast portobello, shiitake, or button mushrooms – whatever you have available! Cut into quarters and drizzle with olive oil and salt! Pro tip: place them cut-side down in a single layer to get that crispy bottom!",
        "Cook! You’ll do this in two iterations at 450°F. First, cook them for 10 minutes. They might start to release some water so now is a great time to remove the liquid from the rimmed baking sheet. Add in the garlic and thyme halfway through so it doesn’t burn! Toss them and then return them to a single layer, preferably on the other cut side for optimal golden-brown color!",
        "Garnish with fresh parsley and enjoy! Roast mushrooms will become caramelized on the outside and soft on the inside!",

        "For generations, small grains such as sorghum, finger millet,  pearl millet and Brown rice(MUPUNGA)have been staples in African households. Despite their long-standing presence in traditional diets, these grains have often been unfairly stigmatized as “food for the poor.” Historically, consuming small grains was seen as a sign of poverty—linked to those who could not afford to grow or purchase maize meal. Yet, this perception is rapidly changing as the value of these traditional grains is being rediscovered.",
        "*Body*",
        "Today, small grains are being hailed as “the new gold” for their impressive health benefits and versatility. They can be consumed whole, cooked, or processed into flour and porridge, among other uses. The recent surge in their popularity is largely due to the global rise in chronic health conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, and cancer. As people search for healthier alternatives, health professionals—particularly nutritionists—have championed the return to traditional diets, urging a shift away from overly processed modern foods."

        "Nutritionally, small grains are powerhouses. Sorghum, finger millet, pearl millet  and brown rice (mupunga)are rich in proteins, essential vitamins, minerals, and complex carbohydrates. While maize meal may contain more carbohydrates, it lacks the diverse range of nutrients present in small grains. One of the standout features of these grains is their high fibre content, which plays a crucial role in preventing constipation and managing blood sugar levels and cholesterol. Regular consumption of high-fibre diets is also linked to lower risks of diabetes, high blood pressure, and certain cancers.",
        "Fibre also aids in weight management. Foods like sorghum leave one feeling full faster and longer, helping to reduce overeating. For maximum benefit, it is recommended to consume whole, unrefined grains to retain the nutrient-rich seed coat. Furthermore, small grains are naturally gluten-free, making them an excellent choice for individuals with gluten sensitivities or celiac disease.",
        "*Conclusion*",
        "Once marginalized and overlooked, small grains are now reclaiming their rightful place at the center of healthy, sustainable eating. Their nutritional value, coupled with growing awareness of health and wellness, has transformed them from “poor man’s food” into a prized staple for those seeking a wholesome, traditional, and disease-preventing diet.",

        "And we're here to demonstrate it! When mushrooms are oven-roasted at high temperatures for a brief period of time, the water is able to escape, leaving behind soft, melt-in-your-mouth interiors and golden-brown caramelized exteriors. You'll find earthy, meaty, herbaceous, and crave-worthy bits of flavor in this recipe for roasted mushrooms. They just require eight ingredients and are quick, simple, and extremely tasty. These are vegan and paleo-friendly, making them the ideal savory side for all dietary requirements! We also enjoy dry-sauté mushrooms, even though roasting them is the simplest way to prepare them and intensify their flavor.",
        "Are Roasted Mushrooms Good For You?",
        "Oven roasted mushrooms are super underrated! Not only are they earthy, savory, and meaty but also are packed with nutrients! Roasted mushrooms in the oven are generally low in calories and fat and are great to bulk up a meal. They contain Vitamin D, riboflavin, potassium and are a good source of fiber! Some experts even say that roast mushrooms can help boost your immune system, have anti-cancer properties, and lower your blood pressure due to their antioxidants!",

        "How Do You Keep Mushrooms From Getting Soggy In The Oven?",
        "…is one of the most common questions we get asked! No one likes soggy, slimy mushrooms and so we’re here to give you all the tips and tricks, for tender, flavorful mushrooms oven roasted with toasty, crispy exteriors:",
        "Gently clean your mushrooms with a paper towel rather than running them under cold water.",
        "Since mushrooms are a high water content food, meaning that their sponge-like structure allows for water to be released during cooking, we recommend that if juices pool halfway through baking, drain them off the tray so they continue to roast instead of steam.",
        "When in doubt, salt after, prevents the water from being released more rapidly during cooking.",
        "_What to Serve with Roasted Mushrooms_",
        "Oven-roasted mushrooms can go with just about any dish: they’re extremely versatile, light yet still hearty!",
        "Sprinkle them over our Creamy Mashed Potatoes and Green Bean Almondine. Add them to Alfredo Sauce or Homemade Marinara to bulk up the sauce. They also go great with pasta such as Vegan Cauliflower Gnocchi, Sausage Kale Pasta with Lemon Cream Sauce, or Creamy Roasted Red Pepper Pasta. There are so many ways to devour roasted mushrooms but our favorite way is straight from the baking sheet.",
        "_How to Roast Mushrooms_",
        "Follow our step-by-step instructions below for perfectly crispy outsides and tender insides each and every time:",
        "Prep! For our roasted mushrooms recipe, we use cremini mushrooms but you can make it your own and roast portobello, shiitake, or button mushrooms – whatever you have available! Cut into quarters and drizzle with olive oil and salt! Pro tip: place them cut-side down in a single layer to get that crispy bottom!",
        "Cook! You’ll do this in two iterations at 450°F. First, cook them for 10 minutes. They might start to release some water so now is a great time to remove the liquid from the rimmed baking sheet. Add in the garlic and thyme halfway through so it doesn’t burn! Toss them and then return them to a single layer, preferably on the other cut side for optimal golden-brown color!",

        "💫“If we plan wisely,” asserts Inspiration, “that which is most conducive to health can be secured in almost every land. The various preparations of rice, wheat, corn, and oats are sent abroad everywhere, also beans, peas, and lentils. These, with native or imported fruits, and the variety of vegetables that grow in each locality, give an opportunity to select a dietary that is complete without the use of fleshmeats.” -- Ministry of Healing, p. 299.",
        "✅Why is it, though, that some strict vegetarians rather than improving their health and building up resistance against disease, often suffer from malnutrition and become even more susceptible to various physical ailments than before they gave up flesh foods? -- Because in most cases flesh food is discarded without supplementing the diet with a satisfactory substitute. Many have the mistaken idea that by merely increasing their intake of protein foods -- nuts, legumes, and grains, they adequately replace the deficiency. By so doing they do not at all replace the deficiency, but instead unbalance the nutrients. Ever remember that flesh is composed of about 80% grass and 20% grain. Biological experiments unmistakably demonstrate that animals cannot thrive on whole grain proteins divorced from the associated leafy plants. The health seeker must bear in mind that often the immediate result of an unbalanced diet is constipation, followed by rheumatism or arthritis, if not by other even more dreadful and destructive diseases. Balance your diet, and Nature will take care of the rest.",
        "🥬The truth that the substances in superior quality flesh are derived from grain and grass, approximately 20% of the former and 80% of the latter plainly demonstrates that flesh is adequately substituted only by the proportionate use of both grain and leafy plants. Be not misled. Your body needs both grain and vegetable proteins in exactly these proportions. Indeed, they are all essential, and man’s constitution demands that for health and longevity there be neither a missing link nor a weak one in the chain of nutriments.",
        "🩺There is also another important lesson in the fact that just as the All-wise Creator did not bless any particular locality with all the riches of creation, but scattered and scientifically proportioned them throughout the earth. He has likewise carefully distributed the essential body-building and upkeeping materials throughout the food kingdom, has not placed them all in one plant.",

        "And we're here to demonstrate it! When mushrooms are oven-roasted at high temperatures for a brief period of time, the water is able to escape, leaving behind soft, melt-in-your-mouth interiors and golden-brown caramelized exteriors. You'll find earthy, meaty, herbaceous, and crave-worthy bits of flavor in this recipe for roasted mushrooms. They just require eight ingredients and are quick, simple, and extremely tasty. These are vegan and paleo-friendly, making them the ideal savory side for all dietary requirements! We also enjoy dry-sauté mushrooms, even though roasting them is the simplest way to prepare them and intensify their flavor.",
        "Are Roasted Mushrooms Good For You?",
        "Oven roasted mushrooms are super underrated! Not only are they earthy, savory, and meaty but also are packed with nutrients! Roasted mushrooms in the oven are generally low in calories and fat and are great to bulk up a meal. They contain Vitamin D, riboflavin, potassium and are a good source of fiber! Some experts even say that roast mushrooms can help boost your immune system, have anti-cancer properties, and lower your blood pressure due to their antioxidants!",

        "…is one of the most common questions we get asked! No one likes soggy, slimy mushrooms and so we’re here to give you all the tips and tricks, for tender, flavorful mushrooms oven roasted with toasty, crispy exteriors:",
        "Gently clean your mushrooms with a paper towel rather than running them under cold water.",
        "Since mushrooms are a high water content food, meaning that their sponge-like structure allows for water to be released during cooking, we recommend that if juices pool halfway through baking, drain them off the tray so they continue to roast instead of steam.",
        "When in doubt, salt after, prevents the water from being released more rapidly during cooking.",
        "_What to Serve with Roasted Mushrooms_",
        "Oven-roasted mushrooms can go with just about any dish: they’re extremely versatile, light yet still hearty!",
        "Sprinkle them over our Creamy Mashed Potatoes and Green Bean Almondine. Add them to Alfredo Sauce or Homemade Marinara to bulk up the sauce. They also go great with pasta such as Vegan Cauliflower Gnocchi, Sausage Kale Pasta with Lemon Cream Sauce, or Creamy Roasted Red Pepper Pasta. There are so many ways to devour roasted mushrooms but our favorite way is straight from the baking sheet.",
        "_How to Roast Mushrooms_",
        "Follow our step-by-step instructions below for perfectly crispy outsides and tender insides each and every time:",
        "Prep! For our roasted mushrooms recipe, we use cremini mushrooms but you can make it your own and roast portobello, shiitake, or button mushrooms – whatever you have available! Cut into quarters and drizzle with olive oil and salt! Pro tip: place them cut-side down in a single layer to get that crispy bottom!",
        "Cook! You’ll do this in two iterations at 450°F. First, cook them for 10 minutes. They might start to release some water so now is a great time to remove the liquid from the rimmed baking sheet. Add in the garlic and thyme halfway through so it doesn’t burn! Toss them and then return them to a single layer, preferably on the other cut side for optimal golden-brown color!",

        "It is important to become familiar with the benefit of dieting in case of sickness. All should understand what to do [for] themselves.—Manuscript 86, 1897 CD 302.1",
        "There are many ways of practicing the healing art; but there is only one way that Heaven approves. God’s remedies are the simple agencies of nature, that will not tax or debilitate the system through their powerful properties. Pure air and water, cleanliness, a proper diet, purity of life, and a firm trust in God, are remedies for the want of which thousands are dying; yet these remedies are going out of date because their skillful use requires work that the people do not appreciate. Fresh air, exercise, pure water, and clean, sweet premises, are within the reach of all, with but little expense; but drugs are expensive, both in the outlay of means, and the effect produced upon the system.—Testimonies for the Church 5:443, 1885 CD 302.2",
        "Pure air, sunlight, abstemiousness, rest, exercise, proper diet, the use of water, trust in divine power,—these are the true remedies. Every person should have a knowledge of nature’s remedial agencies and how to apply them. It is essential both to understand the principles involved in the treatment of the sick and to have a practical training that will enable one rightly to use this knowledge. CD 302.3",
        "The use of natural remedies requires an amount of care and effort that many are not willing to give. Nature’s process of healing and upbuilding is gradual, and to the impatient it seems slow. The surrender of hurtful indulgences requires sacrifice. But in the end it will be found that nature, untrammeled, does her work wisely and well. Those who persevere in obedience to her laws will reap the reward in health of body and health of mind.—The Ministry of Healing, 127, 1905 CD 302.4",
        "Physicians often advise invalids to visit foreign countries, to go to some mineral spring, or to traverse the ocean, in order to regain health; when, in nine cases out of ten, if they would eat temperately, and engage in healthful exercise with a cheerful spirit, they would regain health and save time and money. Exercise, and a free, abundant use of the air and sunlight—blessings which  heaven has bestowed upon all—would in many cases give life and strength to the emaciated invalid.—Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene, 160, 1890 CD 302.5",

        "And we're here to demonstrate it! When mushrooms are oven-roasted at high temperatures for a brief period of time, the water is able to escape, leaving behind soft, melt-in-your-mouth interiors and golden-brown caramelized exteriors. You'll find earthy, meaty, herbaceous, and crave-worthy bits of flavor in this recipe for roasted mushrooms. They just require eight ingredients and are quick, simple, and extremely tasty. These are vegan and paleo-friendly, making them the ideal savory side for all dietary requirements! We also enjoy dry-sauté mushrooms, even though roasting them is the simplest way to prepare them and intensify their flavor.",
        "Are Roasted Mushrooms Good For You?",
        "Oven roasted mushrooms are super underrated! Not only are they earthy, savory, and meaty but also are packed with nutrients! Roasted mushrooms in the oven are generally low in calories and fat and are great to bulk up a meal. They contain Vitamin D, riboflavin, potassium and are a good source of fiber! Some experts even say that roast mushrooms can help boost your immune system, have anti-cancer properties, and lower your blood pressure due to their antioxidants!",

        "…is one of the most common questions we get asked! No one likes soggy, slimy mushrooms and so we’re here to give you all the tips and tricks, for tender, flavorful mushrooms oven roasted with toasty, crispy exteriors:",
        "Gently clean your mushrooms with a paper towel rather than running them under cold water.",
        "Since mushrooms are a high water content food, meaning that their sponge-like structure allows for water to be released during cooking, we recommend that if juices pool halfway through baking, drain them off the tray so they continue to roast instead of steam.",
        "When in doubt, salt after, prevents the water from being released more rapidly during cooking.",
        "_What to Serve with Roasted Mushrooms_",
        "Oven-roasted mushrooms can go with just about any dish: they’re extremely versatile, light yet still hearty!",
        "Sprinkle them over our Creamy Mashed Potatoes and Green Bean Almondine. Add them to Alfredo Sauce or Homemade Marinara to bulk up the sauce. They also go great with pasta such as Vegan Cauliflower Gnocchi, Sausage Kale Pasta with Lemon Cream Sauce, or Creamy Roasted Red Pepper Pasta. There are so many ways to devour roasted mushrooms but our favorite way is straight from the baking sheet.",
        "_How to Roast Mushrooms_",
        "Follow our step-by-step instructions below for perfectly crispy outsides and tender insides each and every time:",
        "Prep! For our roasted mushrooms recipe, we use cremini mushrooms but you can make it your own and roast portobello, shiitake, or button mushrooms – whatever you have available!
