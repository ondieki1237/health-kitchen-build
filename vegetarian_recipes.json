        "The easiest way to incubate and culture your homemade vegan yogurt is with an Instant Pot that has a yogurt setting. That will keep it at a consistent temperature throughout with no effort from you. And its no secret that I love my Instant Pot. I use it for something nearly every single day, including recipes like my Instant Pot Black Beans, Instant Pot Portobello Pot Roast and Instant Pot Tomato Soup and also for cooking rice, grains and oatmeal etc.",
        "A yogurt maker would work well too and if you dont have either of those then you will need to keep your yogurt at a temperature of between 29  C (85  F) and 46  C (115  F). Anything below 29  C (85  F) and youll have trouble getting it to culture.",
        "It is also really important that the yogurt doesnt get close to or above 49C (120 F) because at that temperature the yogurt cultures will start to be killed off and the recipe wont work. Because of this I highly suggest you check the temperature of the yogurts location with a thermometer before you start incubating it if you arent using the controlled environment of an Instant Pot or yogurt maker.",
        "Here are some suggestions for ways to keep your yogurt warm so it cultures successfully",
        "Warm house - If your house is around 29 C (85 F) or more you can leave the covered jars on your countertop away from direct sunlight and in a spot where they wont be disturbed.",
        "In your oven - Preheat your oven to 200  C (400 F) for 1 minute then turn it off. Sit your jars on a baking tray and place them in the oven on the top shelf with the oven light on. Do not open the door for at least 10 hours or the heat will escape.",
        "Use your home heating - Place your jars of yogurt near (but not too near) the furnace, radiator, fireplace, stove.",
        "On top of your fridge/fridge freezer - This is usually a nice warm spot and works well if you dont have built in appliances.",
        "A warm closet - I have forced air heating in my house and the closets have vents into them and get really warm.",

        "Do not omit the sweetener. It is necessary for the bacteria to feed on. Dont worry, your yogurt wont taste sweet because its all consumed by the time the yogurt has fermented.",
        "Canned light coconut milk should be used to make this vegan yogurt recipe. I dont recommend using full fat coconut milk as it will make the yogurt too firm and it also tends to cause separation to occur. Dont be tempted to buy full fat canned coconut milk and dilute it yourself to make light coconut milk. That will not work in this recipe.",
        "Blend everything absolutely thoroughly.",
        "Ensure the yogurt you use to seed your yogurt is a cultured/live one. Most are but double check. If you dont like the results using a particular brand of yogurt try another one next time. Better quality yogurts will give better results.",
        "Makes sure everything is very, very clean.",
        "For this recipe I recommend incubating the yogurt in glass jars. I do not recommend you make it in one big pot, like the Instant Pots inner pot. This is because this yogurt gets the very best texture when it is completely undisturbed while it incubates and chills. If you stir it or disturb it you will lose the lovely thick, creamy texture.",
        "If using an Instant Pot do not set your jars on the trivet. They need to be directly in contact with the inner pot. Dont use the trivet at all.",

Microwave them on high for 45 seconds (do not put metal lids in the microwave - Soak them in boiling water). I also wash my blender jar in hot soapy water, then rinse and fill with boiling water from the kettle, let it sit for a few minutes then pour it out.",
        "Put the cashews in a small bowl and cover them completely with boiling water. Leave them to soak for 20 to 30 minutes. Dont skip this step.",
        "Run a kettle of boiling water through your sieve then drain the cashews really well and add them to a blender. Add the coconut milk, yogurt and maple syrup, then blend until it is completely smooth.",
        "Decant the mixture into clean and dry jars. Any combination of jar sizes that will hold a total of about 600ml (just under 3 cups). I like to use small ones so I have individual sized servings. If you plan on using an Instant Pot make sure before you start filling the jars that they will fit easily together inside the metal inner bowl.",
        "If using an Instant Pot - Place the uncovered yogurt filled jars into the metal inner pot of the Instant Pot. Do not use the trivet and do not add any water to the pot. The jars should be in direct contact with the bottom of the pot and have no lids or other covering on them. Place the lid of the Instant Pot on and close it, then close the steam vent. Press the yogurt button (check that the display says normal and not boil, then adjust the time depending on how long you would like your yogurt to ferment. I suggest a minimum of 10 hours. That will give you a nice thickness and a slight tang. 11.5 hours will give you a more pronounced tang and is how long I leave mine. Do not disturb the Instant Pot/yogurt during this time. You can check it after 10 or 11 hours though. Use a spoon to take a little bit from one jar (without stirring it up first)and taste it. Put the Instant Pot back on again for another hour or two if its not quite tangy enough.",
        "If you dont have an Instant Pot - Cover the filled jars with cheesecloth, clean fluff-free dish towels/cloths, any clean breathable fabric, or paper towels and elastic bands or string to hold it in place. To culture successfully you need to keep the yogurt at a consistent temperature of anywhere between 29  C (85  F) and 46  C (115  F).",
        "If your house is 29 C (85 F) or more you can leave the covered jars on your countertop away from direct sunlight.",
        "If your house is cooler than that, turn your oven to 200  C (400 F) for just 1 minute and no longer. Then turn it off and turn the oven light on. Place the covered jars on a baking tray (for stability) in the oven on the top shelf, with just the oven light on. Do not open the door while it is culturing or you will let the heat out. Also make sure that no-one turns the oven on. A note stuck to the door is a good idea.",
        "Do not disturb the yogurt while it is culturing. At 38  C (100 F) the yogurt will take between 10 to 12 hours to culture, thicken nicely and get a good tang. If the temperature is cooler than that it will take longer and if its warmer then it will happen more quickly. I suggest testing it by scooping a tiny bit out and tasting it after about 10 hours have passed, then add on more time if you want it to be tangier.",
        "Remember that at anything much below a temperature of 29  C (85  F), culturing the yogurt could be problematic, and anything much over 49C (120 F) and the good bacteria will be killed. The yogurt will not culture if that happens. To be absolutely sure that conditions will be right I suggest having a practice run before. Check the temperature of your oven with a thermometer after your oven has preheated for the 1 minute and the light has been turned on. If you find it isnt in the right temperature range there are more suggestions in the recipe notes for ways to incubate.",
        "Once the yogurt has incubated and has reached the right amount of tanginess for you, cover securely with a lid and refrigerate thoroughly. Do not stir it. For best results it needs to be undisturbed until completely chilled. It will thicken more as it chills and will continue to thicken the longer you leave it before eating.",
        "Remember to save a few tablespoons of your yogurt so that you can use it to culture your next batch of homemade vegan yogurt.",
        "If you prefer a sweet yogurt, add more sweetener after the yogurt has fermented and chilled.",
        "NOTES",
        "The milk you use must be light canned coconut milk.  Light coconut milk gives the best and most consistent results. You absolutely cannot use homemade coconut milk, coconut milk from a carton, diluted full fat canned coconut milk, or any other type of plant milk for this recipe. They will not work.  I do not recommend using full fat canned coconut milk because it tends to cause separation issues and makes the yogurt way too thick (almost solid) when chilled.",
        "For slightly thinner yogurt you can safely increase the amount of light coconut milk to 480 ml / 2 cups.",
        "Use glass jars - For this recipe I recommend incubating the yogurt in glass jars. I do not recommend you make it in one big pot, like the Instant Pots inner pot. This is because this yogurt gets the very best texture when it is completely undisturbed while it incubates and chills. If you stir it or disturb it you will lose the lovely thick, creamy texture.",

If youre new to tempeh, youre in the right place because I have created a guide to teach you all about tempeh, its health benefits and how to cook it Tempeh square cut into 4x4 cubes. What is Tempeh You may have seen some of my tempeh recipes and wondered what tempeh is. For starters, its a plant-based protein made of cooked soybeans (think edamame) that have been fermented. The fermentation process binds the soybeans into a cakepatty, which is what youll find at your local grocery store. Some varieties of tempeh only include soybeans, but others will contain grains like barley, rice, flax or millet along with the soybeans. What Does Tempeh Taste Like Tempeh on its own has a mild, nutty flavor thats often described as earthy. Like most proteins, it really takes on the flavor of the dish When prepared with marinades or sauces, it absorbs those flavors and the end result is so tasty. Tempeh vs. Tofu Tempeh is related to tofu, but they arent the same thing They are both made from soy, but other than that theyre actually quite different. Tempeh is less processed, fermented and has a stronger flavor and a bit more texture. Tofu is more processed and has a milder flavor with basically no texture Tofu can be blended up into a creamy sauce or soup or can be fried for more texture, but in general it is much smoother than tempeh. I also find tempeh a bit easier to work with because theres minimal prep work. With tofu you have to account for extra time to press it and with tempeh you simply open the package and youre ready to chop and cook Side by side tempeh rectangles. On the left, the tempeh is out of the packaging, on the right is Lightlife tempeh in the packaging. My Favorite Brand of Tempeh Ive tried a ton of different tempeh varieties and Lightlife is definitely my favorite for a few reasons its organic, GMO-free and easy to find in mainstream stores. I gravitate towards the Three Grain variety because it is the mildest in terms of taste, but I like the original as well You can buy tempeh in most major grocery stores and at every health food store. Youll find it in the refrigerated section, usually by the produce or other plant-based proteins. A square of tempeh that has been sliced into long, thin sections. Health Benefits of Tempeh Tempeh is incredibly healthy Not only is it a complete protein, but its a good source of iron, prebiotics, B vitamins and manganese. A 1 cup serving of tempeh has a whopping 31 grams of protein As I mentioned above, tempeh is a fermented food. This fermentation process breaks down phytic acid, which can inhibit mineral absorption. This means the minerals in tempeh are easier to digest and tempeh is also less likely to cause gas or indigestion when compared to other beans. I dont know about you, but less gas and bloating is always a win in my book Cutting Tempeh Three versions of tempeh that have been sliced, cubed, and cut into triangles. There are so many different ways to cut tempeh, but here are my go-to methods Thin slices if Im using tempeh to make my tempeh bacon, blackened tempeh salad or vegan breakfast sandwich I like to cut the tempeh into 14 thick stripsslices. Cubes or triangles if the tempeh is the star of the recipe like in this vegan sweet and sour or tempeh butternut squash bake I like to cut it into cubes or triangles. For cubes, just try to keep cut them into the same sized cubes so they cook evenly. To cut tempeh into triangles, cut the tempeh in half width-wise. Cut each half in a star pattern to get 16 mini triangles per package of tempeh, 32 triangles total. Crumbled crumbled tempeh is a great substitute for recipes that typically have ground meat like these tempeh tacos or this tempeh bolognese sauce. To crumble tempeh, simply break it apart with your hands until you reach a desired consistency, similar to that of ground meat. A close up of tempeh triangles marinating in a maple balsamic glaze. How to Cook Tempeh Packaged tempeh is pre-cooked so you can easily enjoy it right from the package (on sandwiches, salads, etc), but I highly recommend cooking it so that it tastes better. A lot of people suggest steaming the tempeh before marinating or cooking to help remove any bitterness. I honestly dont take the time to do this, but if youd like to try it heres the process. To steam the tempeh, cut it as desired, place in a steamer basket, cover and steam for 10-15 minutes. If you dont have a steamer basket, you can fill a saucepan with 1-2 inches of water and bring it to a boil. Once boiling place the tempeh in the saucepan, cover and reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes. My favorite way to make tempeh taste amazing is to marinate it You can marinate in the fridge anywhere from one hour to overnight. The longer it marinates the longer the tempeh has time to soak up all the flavors. Im sharing a simple tempeh marinade below made of maple syrup, balsamic vinegar, oil, tamari and garlic. Its a staple recipe in our house Once your tempeh is prepped and marinated, its time to cook it You have a few options. Heres what I recommend Pan sauté I typically sauté my tempeh. Heat 1 Tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tempeh and cook until golden brown, about 4-5 minutes per side. Bake Baking tempeh is a great hands-off cooking option Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Spread the tempeh evenly and bake at 400ºF for about 25 minutes or until golden brown. Air fry If you have an air fryer, this is a great option for crispy and delicious tempeh Add the tempeh to the basket and bake at 375ºF for about 15 minutes. Toss every 5 minutes for even cooking. Marinated tempeh thats finished cooking in a large skillet. How to Serve This Marinated Tempeh This marinated tempeh is lovely served over rice or another grain like quinoa or millet. You can also serve it on cauliflower rice for a low-carb option. You can also pair it with a veggie side like my roasted broccoli or kale salad or try it in my tempeh bowls with pumpkin rice. This easy marinated tempeh is my favorite way to cook tempeh. The maple balsamic sauce gives the tempeh so much flavor Prep Time 1hour hour Cook Time 12minutes minutes Total Time 1hour hour 12minutes minutes Servings 6 Ingredients 1x 2x 3x 2 8 oz packages tempeh ¼ cup maple syrup ¼ cup balsamic vinegar 2 teaspoons avocado , or olive oil 3 Tablespoons low sodium tamari, soy sauce or coconut aminos 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 Tablespoon avocado or olive oil, for cooking Remove tempeh from package and chop into small triangles by cutting the tempeh in half width-wise. Cut each half in a star pattern to get 16 mini triangles per package of tempeh, 32 triangles total. In a small bowl combine maple syrup, balsamic vinegar, tamari, 2 teaspoons oil and minced garlic. Add tempeh triangles into a shallow dish with a large surface area, pour maple balsamic marinade over the tempeh, toss to coat and let tempeh marinate in the fridge for 1 24 hours. Stir the mixture a couple times while marinating, if possible. Pan-glaze the tempeh by heating 1 Tablespoon avocado oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once oil is hot, add the tempeh (without pouring the marinade in) and cook until golden brown on each side, allowing 4-5 minutes per side. Pour the maple balsamic marinade into the pan with the tempeh and simmer another 5-7 minutes, or until the sauce has reduced creating a glaze on the tempeh. Toss the tempeh a couple times during this process. Once the sauce has thickened and all tempeh pieces are coated, the tempeh is ready to be served. I recommend serving it over rice, cauliflower rice or another grain and a veggie side.",

      "instructions": "267 75 841 385 What Is Tempeh (and How to Cook It) What is tempeh and how do you cook it Here Im sharing a guide to all things tempeh along with my favorite marinated tempeh recipe. If youre new to tempeh, youre in the right place because I have created a guide to teach you all about tempeh, its health benefits and how to cook it Tempeh square cut into 4x4 cubes. What is Tempeh You may have seen some of my tempeh recipes and wondered what tempeh is. For starters, its a plant-based protein made of cooked soybeans (think edamame) that have been fermented. The fermentation process binds the soybeans into a cakepatty, which is what youll find at your local grocery store. Some varieties of tempeh only include soybeans, but others will contain grains like barley, rice, flax or millet along with the soybeans. What Does Tempeh Taste Like Tempeh on its own has a mild, nutty flavor thats often described as earthy. Like most proteins, it really takes on the flavor of the dish When prepared with marinades or sauces, it absorbs those flavors and the end result is so tasty. Tempeh vs. Tofu Tempeh is related to tofu, but they arent the same thing They are both made from soy, but other than that theyre actually quite different. Tempeh is less processed, fermented and has a stronger flavor and a bit more texture. Tofu is more processed and has a milder flavor with basically no texture Tofu can be blended up into a creamy sauce or soup or can be fried for more texture, but in general it is much smoother than tempeh. I also find tempeh a bit easier to work with because theres minimal prep work. With tofu you have to account for extra time to press it and with tempeh you simply open the package and youre ready to chop and cook Side by side tempeh rectangles. On the left, the tempeh is out of the packaging, on the right is Lightlife tempeh in the packaging. My Favorite Brand of Tempeh Ive tried a ton of different tempeh varieties and Lightlife is definitely my favorite for a few reasons its organic, GMO-free and easy to find in mainstream stores. I gravitate towards the Three Grain variety because it is the mildest in terms of taste, but I like the original as well You can buy tempeh in most major grocery stores and at every health food store. Youll find it in the refrigerated section, usually by the produce or other plant-based proteins. A square of tempeh that has been sliced into long, thin sections. Health Benefits of Tempeh Tempeh is incredibly healthy Not only is it a complete protein, but its a good source of iron, prebiotics, B vitamins and manganese. A 1 cup serving of tempeh has a whopping 31 grams of protein As I mentioned above, tempeh is a fermented food. This fermentation process breaks down phytic acid, which can inhibit mineral absorption. This means the minerals in tempeh are easier to digest and tempeh is also less likely to cause gas or indigestion when compared to other beans. I dont know about you, but less gas and bloating is always a win in my book Cutting Tempeh Three versions of tempeh that have been sliced, cubed, and cut into triangles. There are so many different ways to cut tempeh, but here are my go-to methods Thin slices if Im using tempeh to make my tempeh bacon, blackened tempeh salad or vegan breakfast sandwich I like to cut the tempeh into 14 thick stripsslices. Cubes or triangles if the tempeh is the star of the recipe like in this vegan sweet and sour or tempeh butternut squash bake I like to cut it into cubes or triangles. For cubes, just try to keep cut them into the same sized cubes so they cook evenly. To cut tempeh into triangles, cut the tempeh in half width-wise. Cut each half in a star pattern to get 16 mini triangles per package of tempeh, 32 triangles total. Crumbled crumbled tempeh is a great substitute for recipes that typically have ground meat like these tempeh tacos or this tempeh bolognese sauce. To crumble tempeh, simply break it apart with your hands until you reach a desired consistency, similar to that of ground meat. A close up of tempeh triangles marinating in a maple balsamic glaze. How to Cook Tempeh Packaged tempeh is pre-cooked so you can easily enjoy it right from the package (on sandwiches, salads, etc), but I highly recommend cooking it so that it tastes better. A lot of people suggest steaming the tempeh before marinating or cooking to help remove any bitterness. I honestly dont take the time to do this, but if youd like to try it heres the process. To steam the tempeh, cut it as desired, place in a steamer basket, cover and steam for 10-15 minutes. If you dont have a steamer basket, you can fill a saucepan with 1-2 inches of water and bring it to a boil. Once boiling place the tempeh in the saucepan, cover and reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes. My favorite way to make tempeh taste amazing is to marinate it You can marinate in the fridge anywhere from one hour to overnight. The longer it marinates the longer the tempeh has time to soak up all the flavors. Im sharing a simple tempeh marinade below made of maple syrup, balsamic vinegar, oil, tamari and garlic. Its a staple recipe in our house Once your tempeh is prepped and marinated, its time to cook it You have a few options. Heres what I recommend Pan sauté I typically sauté my tempeh. Heat 1 Tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tempeh and cook until golden brown, about 4-5 minutes per side. Bake Baking tempeh is a great hands-off cooking option Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Spread the tempeh evenly and bake at 400ºF for about 25 minutes or until golden brown. Air fry If you have an air fryer, this is a great option for crispy and delicious tempeh Add the tempeh to the basket and bake at 375ºF for about 15 minutes. Toss every 5 minutes for even cooking. Marinated tempeh thats finished cooking in a large skillet. How to Serve This Marinated Tempeh This marinated tempeh is lovely served over rice or another grain like quinoa or millet. You can also serve it on cauliflower rice for a low-carb option. You can also pair it with a veggie side like my roasted broccoli or kale salad or try it in my tempeh bowls with pumpkin rice. This easy marinated tempeh is my favorite way to cook tempeh. The maple balsamic sauce gives the tempeh so much flavor Prep Time 1hour hour Cook Time 12minutes minutes Total Time 1hour hour 12minutes minutes Servings 6 Ingredients 1x 2x 3x 2 8 oz packages tempeh ¼ cup maple syrup ¼ cup balsamic vinegar 2 teaspoons avocado , or olive oil 3 Tablespoons low sodium tamari, soy sauce or coconut aminos 3 cloves garlic, minced 1 Tablespoon avocado or olive oil, for cooking Remove tempeh from package and chop into small triangles by cutting the tempeh in half width-wise. Cut each half in a star pattern to get 16 mini triangles per package of tempeh, 32 triangles total. In a small bowl combine maple syrup, balsamic vinegar, tamari, 2 teaspoons oil and minced garlic. Add tempeh triangles into a shallow dish with a large surface area, pour maple balsamic marinade over the tempeh, toss to coat and let tempeh marinate in the fridge for 1 24 hours. Stir the mixture a couple times while marinating, if possible. Pan-glaze the tempeh by heating 1 Tablespoon avocado oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once oil is hot, add the tempeh (without pouring the marinade in) and cook until golden brown on each side, allowing 4-5 minutes per side. Pour the maple balsamic marinade into the pan with the tempeh and simmer another 5-7 minutes, or until the sauce has reduced creating a glaze on the tempeh. Toss the tempeh a couple times during this process. Once the sauce has thickened and all tempeh pieces are coated, the tempeh is ready to be served. I recommend serving it over rice, cauliflower rice or another grain and a veggie side. 267 75 841 385 _How is tempeh made step by step_ Steps 1 Soaking.

For really good clumps, press down on the finished granola before it cools and avoid jostling it on the pan until cooled completely.",

These are vegan and paleo-friendly, making them the ideal savory side for all dietary requirements We also enjoy dry-sauté mushrooms, even though roasting them is the simplest way to prepare them and intensify their flavor.",
        "Are Roasted Mushrooms Good For You",
        "Oven roasted mushrooms are super underrated Not only are they earthy, savory, and meaty but also are packed with nutrients Roasted mushrooms in the oven are generally low in calories and fat and are great to bulk up a meal. They contain Vitamin D, riboflavin, potassium and are a good source of fiber Some experts even say that roast mushrooms can help boost your immune system, have anti-cancer properties, and lower your blood pressure due to their antioxidants",

        "How Do You Keep Mushrooms From Getting Soggy In The Oven",
        "is one of the most common questions we get asked No one likes soggy, slimy mushrooms and so were here to give you all the tips and tricks, for tender, flavorful mushrooms oven roasted with toasty, crispy exteriors",
        "Gently clean your mushrooms with a paper towel rather than running them under cold water.",
        "Since mushrooms are a high water content food, meaning that their sponge-like structure allows for water to be released during cooking, we recommend that if juices pool halfway through baking, drain them off the tray so they continue to roast instead of steam.",
        "When in doubt, salt after, prevents the water from being released more rapidly during cooking.",

        "Sprinkle them over our Creamy Mashed Potatoes and Green Bean Almondine. Add them to Alfredo Sauce or Homemade Marinara to bulk up the sauce. They also go great with pasta such as Vegan Cauliflower Gnocchi, Sausage Kale Pasta with Lemon Cream Sauce, or Creamy Roasted Red Pepper Pasta. There are so many ways to devour roasted mushrooms but our favorite way is straight from the baking sheet.",
        "_How to Roast Mushrooms_",
        "Prep For our roasted mushrooms recipe, we use cremini mushrooms but you can make it your own and roast portobello, shiitake, or button mushrooms  whatever you have available Cut into quarters and drizzle with olive oil and salt Pro tip place them cut-side down in a single layer to get that crispy bottom",
        "Cook Youll do this in two iterations at 450F. First, cook them for 10 minutes. They might start to release some water so now is a great time to remove the liquid from the rimmed baking sheet. Add in the garlic and thyme halfway through so it doesnt burn Toss them and then return them to a single layer, preferably on the other cut side for optimal golden-brown color",
